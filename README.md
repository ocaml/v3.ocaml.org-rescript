# next.ocaml.org

**Status:** Private repository, still a work in progress.

This is the working repository for v3 of the ocaml.org site, and the first
major upgrade to the infrastructure since the v2 launch in 2012.  It will
feature the major following improvements when completed:

- Responsive-first design with improved accessibility on mobile devices.  This
  is powered by a switch from an old version of Bootstrap to Tailwind 2.

- Streamlined site design that takes all of the content added over the course
  of the last decade into account and presents it more logically.

- Separation of data editing from HTML/CSS generation.  The v2 site combined
  (e.g.) fetching external newsfeeds with the HTML generation, whereas this v3
  site keeps a structured store of data, which is then parsed to generate the
  website.  We use ReScript/OCaml to generate the site content, and Ocurrent to
  automate the data pipelines.

- Integrated documentation and package management. The v3 site will combine the
  package management (currently opam.ocaml.org) with a new central
  documentation source (codenamed 'docs.ocaml.org') within the ocaml.org site.

- Original content on the ocaml.org site, such as all of the media from the
  last few decades of conference talks. The v2 site only syndicated from
  external sources, but now we can publish editorial content from around the
  community directly on ocaml.org.

Since this site is a work-in-progress, not all of the above features are yet
materialised in this repository. As the team shows the site to more
stakeholders in the ocaml.org ecosystem, we will expand the supported
featureset.
