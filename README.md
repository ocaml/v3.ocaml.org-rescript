## Issue workflow

### Contributor

Feel free to use any approach that you prefer. The dev team
suggests the following:
* If you are unsure if your change will be accepted or if want to discuss the
approach before diving in, please create an issue and pose questions.
* Create a draft PR with a small initial commit in fork of the repo. One way
to do this quickly is the following:
  * traverse to a source file of interest in github
  * click the "pencil" edit icon in the top right, which forks the project and puts the file in edit mode
  * make a small change to get started in the edit window
  * push "propose changes", which will create a commit and prompt for PR creation
  * click "Create Pull Request"
  * select a template by appending the following to the url: `template=webpage_implement.md`, inserting a `?` before, if not already present
  * on the next screen, change the action to "Create draft pull request" and press the button
* Clone your fork locally (or continue editing directly in github if the change is small). Checkout
out the branch that you created.
* Continue developing, feel free to ask questions in
the PR, if you run into obstacles or uncertainty as you make changes
* Once you feel your branch is ready, check the PR preview to ensure the changes
match your local view and appear correct
* Review your implementation according to the checks notes in the PR template
* Change PR status to "ready to review"
* Update the PR description to indicate relative paths that have changed

### Reviewer

## Setup and Development

If you don't already have `nvm` installed, install it using the instructions
provided by `nvm` https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating . Restart
or reload your terminal to pickup the changes.

Install node and javascript libraries and tools:

```
make install-deps
```

Run ReScript compiler in watch mode:

```
make rescript-watch
```

In another tab, run the Next dev server:

```
make next-dev
```

The output from the next dev server is rarely interesting, so you might save some
real estate by running the command in the background. This frees up the second terminal for performing `git` commands.

Go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Tips

### res_pages vs pages

ReScript can only handle one module of a given name, e.g. "Index". This clashes with nextjs
page-based routing, which expects the filepath starting from `/pages/` to match
the route exposed. So, in order to completely avoid any problems from this issue,
we always create pages in `res_pages/` and rewrap the module in the desired location
in `pages/`. If your module uses `getStaticPaths` or `getStaticProps`, those will also
need to be re-exposed. Also, note that we choose to repeat the folder name (e.g. "releases") 
in the module name (e.g. "ReleasesIndex.js").

### Do not use nextjs server side features, such as getServerSideProps

In order to ensure that this site remains a static site, do not make use of nextjs's
`getServerSideProps` functionality. More [functionality to avoid is enumerated in the nextjs docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export#caveats).

### Prefer Simplicity over Accomodating Fast Refresh

We choose to not complicate this project to accomodate Fast Refresh.


## Useful commands

Build CSS seperately via `npx postcss` (useful for debugging)

```
nvm install && npx postcss@8.3.1 styles/main.css -o /tmp/test.css
```

## Test production setup with Next

TODO: change this to use `export` and `start` with output dir, instead of `start` directly
```
nvm install && npx yarn@1.22 install && npx yarn build && PORT=3001 npx yarn next:start
```

## Reference

This is a NextJS project using the following:

- [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org) + React (reason-react)
- Full Tailwind config & basic css scaffold
- Mdxjs (via next-mdx-remote)

The initial structure was defined by imitating a combination of choices in the following projects, with
rescriptlang.org taking precedence when there was conflicting advice:

- [rescript-nextjs starter](https://github.com/ryyppy/rescript-nextjs-template)
- [rescript-lang.org website](https://github.com/reason-association/rescript-lang.org)
- [nextjs tailwind example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)
- [nextjs mdxjs example using mdx-remote](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote)
