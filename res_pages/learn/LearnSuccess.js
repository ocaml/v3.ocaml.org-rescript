Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with \n  updates to both replicas: updates that do not conflict are propagated automatically and conflicting \n  updates are detected and displayed. Unison is also resilient to failure: it is careful to leave \n  the replicas and its own private structures in a sensible state at all times, even in case of \n  abnormal termination or communication failures."));
